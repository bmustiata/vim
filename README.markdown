# bmustiata's vim settings

These are just my settings, you probably don't need them.

If you do want them, note that you'll need a vim that has lua and python support,
and the [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) installed.

Running xterm the right way can be done with:

```sh
xterm -fa "Ubuntu Mono derivative Powerline:size=12:antialias=false"
```
